+ï»¿# Contributing guide
+
+This document serves as a checklist before contributing to this repository. It includes links to read up on if topics are unclear to you.
+
+This guide mainly focuses on the proper use of Git.
+
+## 1. Issues
+
+STM32MPU projects do not activate "Github issues" feature for the time being. If you need to report an issue or question about this project deliverables, you can report them using [ ST Support Center ](https://my.st.com/ols#/ols/newrequest)  or  [ ST Community MPU Forum ](https://community.st.com/s/topic/0TO0X0000003u2AWAQ/stm32-mpus).
+
+## 2. Pull Requests
+
+STMicrolectronics is happy to receive contributions from the community, based on an initial Contributor License Agreement (CLA) procedure.
+
+* If you are an individual writing original source code and you are sure **you own the intellectual property**, then you need to sign an Individual CLA (https://cla.st.com).
+* If you work for a company that wants also to allow you to contribute with your work, your company needs to provide a Corporate CLA (https://cla.st.com) mentioning your GitHub account name.
+* If you are not sure that a CLA (Individual or Corporate) has been signed for your GitHub account you can check here (https://cla.st.com).
+
+Please note that:
+* The Corporate CLA will always take precedence over the Individual CLA.
+* One CLA submission is sufficient, for any project proposed by STMicroelectronics.
+
+__How to proceed__
+
+* We recommend to fork the project in your GitHub account to further develop your contribution. Please use the latest commit version.
+* Please, submit one Pull Request for one new feature or proposal. This will ease the analysis and final merge if accepted.
+
+__Note__
+
+Merge will not be done directly in GitHub but it will need first to follow internal integration process before public deliver in a standard release. The Pull request will stay open until it is merged and delivered.
