Subject: [PATCH 1108/1141] ARM: dts: stm32: fix irq type of touchscreen on
 stm32mp157 EV1 boards

The touchscreen driver goodix_ts ignores the interrupt type set in
the DT; it queries the touchscreen firmware for the interrupt type
to be requested.
When the touchscreen device is unbound, the interrupt keeps the
type already requested.
On a following bind of the same driver, the interrupt framework
will find that the interrupt is already registered and will check
if its interrupt type matches the DT; in case of type mismatch the
bind will fail.

The touchscreen firmware can be update during the product life,
thus the interrupt type can change.

Use IRQ_TYPE_NONE in the DT, as it works as a wildcard and matches
any interrupt type requested by the firmware.

Current touchscreen firmware in stm32mp157 EV1 require falling
edge type, that mismatches the type in DT and prevents re-binding
the device.
