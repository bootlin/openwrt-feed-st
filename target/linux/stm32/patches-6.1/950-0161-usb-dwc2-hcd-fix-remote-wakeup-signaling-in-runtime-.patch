Subject: [PATCH 161/529] usb: dwc2: hcd: fix remote wakeup signaling in
 runtime PM resume

An endless "loop" is seen with PM runtime auto suspend (wakeup event),
then resume is seen in dwc2 hcd, but no real wakeup event is seen.
This happens upon/after an unplug/disconnect of a device.
_dwc2_hcd_suspend/resume are called several times at this point.
Then, the sequence seen repeatedly basically is:
- usb_runtime_suspend ... hcd_bus_suspend _dwc2_hcd_suspend
- usb_runtime_suspend ... get hub_status_data (result is != 0) due to
  port_suspend_change is already 1
- usb_runtime_suspend ... hcd_bus_resume set port_suspend_change to 1.
Enabling debug shows "suspend raced with wakeup event" log continuously,
until a new device is plugged in, or the dwc2 is switched to device mode.

port_suspend_change flag is already handled for remote wakeup at other
places in the driver. It shouldn't be set unconditionally in bus resume
routine. So remove it from the bus resume routine.
