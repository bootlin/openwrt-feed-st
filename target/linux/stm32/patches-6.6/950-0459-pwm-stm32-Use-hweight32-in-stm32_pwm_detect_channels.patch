Subject: [PATCH] pwm: stm32: Use hweight32 in stm32_pwm_detect_channels
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ Upstream commit 41fa8f57c0d269243fe3bde2bce71e82c884b9ad ]

Use hweight32() to count the CCxE bits in stm32_pwm_detect_channels().
Since the return value is assigned to chip.npwm, change it to unsigned
int as well.
