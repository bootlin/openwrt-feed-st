Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: st: add lvds support on stm32mp253
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This patch adds LVDS support on stm32mp253. The Low Voltage Differential
Signaling is used on STM32MP2 as a display interface. It maps the stream of
pixel received from the LTDC and handles LVDS protocols onto a display panel.
