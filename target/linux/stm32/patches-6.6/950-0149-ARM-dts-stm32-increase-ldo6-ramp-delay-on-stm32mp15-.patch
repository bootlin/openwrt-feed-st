Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: increase ldo6 ramp delay on stm32mp15 eval
 boards

At initialization Wolfson wm8894 suspend/resume callbacks
are executed. On resume LDO6 regulator is re-enabled.
wm8994 Power On Reset must be in ready state to allow
accesses on control interface. Measurements on wm8994
show that POR is not in ready state before 170ms after
LDO6 activation. The LDO6 ramp-up delay is set to 300ms
to let enough time for wm8994 POR.
